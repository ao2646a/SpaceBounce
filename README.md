# SpaceBounce 2D-Platformer
To complete the Midterm 2D-Platformer game requirement of the Game Development Fall 2021 Core Course, we created a two-player competitive game that defies normal physics. Using the UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys and W, S, A, and D, two people can bounce on objects and eachother to try to push the other off of the platform. Each member created their own level resulting in three total levels that players can choose from. Each level features a different world setting and additional enemy component.
